# Mahara Match — Task Tracker

Progress ledger for the Mahara Match build brief. Update this file as milestones
are implemented and verified; do not mark a task complete before its acceptance
checks pass.

Status: `[ ]` todo · `[/]` in progress · `[x]` completed · `[!]` blocked

## Current focus

    `docs/PILOT_RELEASE_GATES.md`.

- [x] Marketplace Phase 4 — Service requests and eligible reviews.
  - [x] Add requester-owned service requests linked directly to User; no
    customer role or customer profile is required.

    request, requester confirmation, cancellation, and issue reporting.
  - [x] Notify providers and restrict request details to the two participants.

    reviews only on public professional profiles.
  - [x] Add authenticated request management and preserve a guest service
    request intent through sign-in.
  - [x] Verify frontend production build and workspace diagnostics.
- [x] Marketplace Phase 3 — Missions and proposals.
  - [x] Add individual and employer-organisation mission publishing, public
    discovery, search filters, and pagination.

    mission discovery.
  - [x] Verify frontend production build and workspace diagnostics.
- [x] Task 13 — Employer recruitment lifecycle foundations.

    education, experience, and skill profile fields.
  - [x] Add a Derja-capable local LLM chat adapter with candidate-reviewed
    profile suggestions and a manual profile editor.
  - [x] Add local Whisper transcription and server-side TTS adapters with
    explicit unavailable-service and text fallbacks.
  - [x] Reuse the assistant for profile updates after onboarding; audit service
    requests without storing profile values, chat messages, or raw audio.

    contracts, confirmation-before-save, migrations, and UI onboarding.
- [/] Task 2 — Derja chatbot, manual fallback, and session history.
  - [x] Add a Derja-capable career chat with a direct route to manual profile
    editing when the assistant is unavailable.
  - [x] Persist candidate-owned chat sessions with list, reopen, and delete

## Build order

- [x] Task 1 — Roles, access control, demo users, and audit log.
- [x] Task 7 — Candidate skill matching, employer offers, and role-specific
  assistant guidance.
- [x] Task 8 — Candidate registration, onboarding, and reusable profile
  assistant.
- [x] Task 5 — Reproducible synthetic data generator.
  - [x] Generate deterministic, explicitly labelled synthetic Tunisian job
    offers from a seed and write JSONL fixtures.
- [x] Task 3 — Authorised data collection and ingestion pipeline.
  - [x] Collect France unemployment time series from the public Eurostat API
    and France Travail BMO metadata and the latest occupation/area estimates.
  - [x] Save raw snapshots, normalized records, source/licence metadata, and
    checksums; report source failures explicitly.
- [X] Task 2 — Derja chatbot, manual fallback, and session history.
- [x] Task 10 — Hybrid RAG assistant and Tunisian labour-market intelligence.
- [x] Task 4 — Deterministic career roadmap engine and screens.
  - [x] Build roadmap steps from profile skill gaps in published job offers,
    prioritizing skills requested by more offers.
  - [x] Add candidate progress tracking and a responsive roadmap screen.
  - [x] Add role-restricted API, persistence migration, and regression tests.
- [X] Task 9 — Interview preparation and hard/soft skills review.
  - [x] Phase 0 — Inspect architecture and identify reusable profile, offer,
    permission, assistant, training, and frontend components.
  - [x] Phase 1 — Add a competency catalog, proficiency scale, candidate skill
    comparison, offer-based role profiles, and clearly labeled behavioral and
    communication suggestions.
  - [x] Phase 2 — Generate knowledge, practical, and scenario questions from
    offer skills; persist candidate-owned sessions, answers, and evaluations.
    Score objective Python/SQL questions deterministically, validate structured
    local-assistant feedback for open answers, and keep code execution disabled.
  - [x] Phase 3 — Add saved behavioral and situational assessment sessions
    for the supported soft-skill catalog, accept candidate-owned text answers,
    and provide structured STAR evaluation and improvement feedback without
    inferring personality or penalizing non-professional experience.
  - [x] Phase 4 — Capture technical and behavioral interview answers in the
    browser, asynchronously transcribe them, and let candidates review/edit
    transcripts before submission. Persist job status and transcript only;
    validate ownership and audio type/size, and never retain raw audio.
    Verify recorder/upload/review UI, API ownership and failure states,
    migration, backend suite (111), frontend suite, and production build.
  - [x] Phase 5 — Analyze communication signals and provide exercises.
    Draft interview responses are scored for structure, concrete examples,
    and result clarity; the UI surfaces a short communication coach and a
    set of practice exercises. Validate with the interview-prep frontend
    suite and the production build.
  - [x] Phase 6 — Orchestrate adaptive mock interviews.
  - [X] Phase 7 — Integrate candidate CV evidence into the selected role
    preparation profile, showing saved education and experience as candidate-
    provided interview evidence with an empty state when none is available.
    Pending backend/frontend regression checks.
  - [X] Phase 8 — Recommend published provider courses that cover missing
    skills required by the selected role; rank by matching skill coverage and
    show the course details and match reasons. Pending regression checks.
  - [x] Phase 9 — Add reports and progress tracking.
    Summarize completed technical and behavioral responses into a simple
    interview-prep report with question counts, score averages, and a
    progress bar, plus coaching recommendations for the next practice round.
  - [/] Phase 10 — Complete end-to-end integration, validation, and
    optimization.
- [x] Task 11 — Administration and training-provider dashboards.
- [ ] Task 6, part 2 — Polish the remaining screens in the brief's order.

## Project baseline / guardrails

- The project started with no application source, routes, models, migrations,
  or tests; see `docs/AUDIT.md`.
- The brief's stack is the project baseline. No pre-existing behavior is being
  replaced.
- Features not implemented are unavailable; the initial UI uses empty states
  rather than simulated platform data.
- Latest checks: frontend production build passed; frontend tests passed
  (including interview recording and transcript review); full API test suite
  passed (111), including marketplace role/ownership, SQLite migrations through
  revision 0010, behavioral and technical assessment persistence and scoring,
  interview transcription job ownership/failure states, roadmap, permissions,
  and assistant retrieval/routing. The new migration through revision 0010 passed
  SQLite integration checks
  and PostgreSQL static SQL generation. PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector was
  migrated through revision 0006; six approved Tunisia/France documents and
  361 384-dimensional chunks were ingested. Live PostgreSQL vector,
  full-text-only, country-filtered, French, and Arabic retrieval checks passed
  against the local multilingual embedding service.
- PostgreSQL-backed authentication and role infrastructure are implemented.
  Candidate profiles and employer job offers are persisted; the match score
  is deterministic required-skill overlap. Candidate profile assistance uses
  configured local model services without persisted history; career assistant
  conversations are persisted in candidate-owned sessions. Career roadmaps
  are deterministic skill-gap plans based on published offers, with
  candidate-owned progress. Job applications and provider courses,
  enrollments, and completions are persisted; the administration dashboard
  reports aggregate data and explicitly employer-reported hiring outcomes.
- API liveness is process-only; it intentionally does not imply database
  readiness.
- Live PostgreSQL authentication was rejected by the current local connection
  settings, so the migration and demo seed were not exercised against that
  server; see the migration SQL and SQLite integration checks above.
- GitHub PR is not yet possible: this local git repository has no commits or
  remote. User requested PR and merge; destination remote/base branch are
  required before publication.
- Continue from this file and the audit. Review only files relevant to the
  current milestone; update the ledger after verification.
